## About the Project

This project simulates a real-world library management system where users (members and librarians) can manage books, eBooks, and research journals efficiently. The system supports adding, searching, issuing, and returning books. It utilizes C++ OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, combined with linked lists and STL containers for managing collections. Templates and exception handling ensure robust and reusable code.

## Features

- Add, delete, and search for books, eBooks, and research journals  
- Manage library members and librarian operations  
- Issue and return books with transaction tracking  
- Use of linked lists for dynamic data management  
- Use of STL stack and queue for additional data structures  
- Template functions for code reusability  
- Exception handling for error management  
- User-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI)
